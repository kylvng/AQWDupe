# *AQW Dupe*

This web app: **Simulates the experience of creating your own hero in the world of AQW (nostalgic game I played when I was a kid). This web app interacts with a supabase database to practice CRUD concepts.**

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

 - **A create form allows users to add new crewmates**
 - **Users can name the crewmate and set the crewmate's attributes by clicking on one of several values**

## Notes

The CSS took very long, but the supabase interactions were pretty easy to follow.
